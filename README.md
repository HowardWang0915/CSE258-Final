```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```

To load the data into a pickle file, run
```bash
python helpers/load.py -c NUM
```
where `NUM` is the number of data you intended to load. Because this is a large dataset, choose the number wisely otherwise your computer might crash like mine :(.

## Run
To run Exploratory data analysis, run
```bash
python EDA.py
```
